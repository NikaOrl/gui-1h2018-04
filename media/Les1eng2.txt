During the winter, bears usually sleep because the weather is too cold and there is no food. While sleeping, a bear can lose 80 kilos. Russian people resemble bears very much. In winter they also become slow and sleep a lot because it is too cold and dark outside. 
That is why Russians love bears and call them "mishki". Misha is the mascot of the 1980 Summer Olympic Games in Moscow.
